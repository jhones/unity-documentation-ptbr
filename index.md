LibDoc is a lightweight Jekyll theme dedicated to documentation of CSS and Javascript libraries. It comes with a [built-in playground](libdoc-playground.html) and [search engine](libdoc-sidebar.html#search).

```html
<header class="px-8 py-8 mx-auto bg-blue-100 text-center">
    <h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl leading-none font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 mt-0 mb-8">
        I am a playground
    </h1>
    <p class="max-w-screen-lg text-lg sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 font-medium mb-10 sm:mb-11">
        This playground is played into a dedicated iframe with its own context with user defined CSS and Javascript.
    </p>
</header>
