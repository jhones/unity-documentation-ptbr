* **Dual context: LibDoc + Playground** <br>LibDoc was made to craft documentation with its own embedded demos and examples which have their own CSS and JS resources defined into the [config.yml](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-config.html#playground), just like any code sandbox.<br><br>
* **Github Pages compatible** <br>LibDoc runs **without Gem, without plugin**, it is lightweight and can run locally, depending on the resources you set into the [configuration](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-config.html).<br><br>
